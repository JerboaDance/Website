Gabe is excited to be dancing again after spending the last 3 years making two tiny humans from scratch.

She studied in Northern Utah with Sandra Emile of Cache Valley Civic Ballet. In college, studying Modern Dance at Weber State University and then  made her way to the University of Utah, department of Modern Dance.

Gabe has been teaching dance to kids and adults in private studios for the past ten years. Her greatest purpose is to kindle a respect and passion for art, performance, and self love through the journey of kinesthetic awareness.
